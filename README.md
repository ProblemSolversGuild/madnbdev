Understood, I will adhere to the rules you’ve outlined.

**SCENE PLOT: You are in an interrogation room questioning Goldilocks
about a recent burglary. She doesn’t know you have an ace up your
sleeve**

DETECTIVE MAXWELL: Alright Miss Goldilocks, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way. You see, I have surveillance video clearly showing you
entering the Bears’ residence. Can you explain why exactly you were
there? *He leans back in his chair, watching her reaction closely*

**SCENE PLOT: You are being interrogated by a detective about a burglary
that you definitely committed, but you aren’t going to give him the
satisfaction of cracking the case. After all, you are a hardened
criminal that lives for the rush of the crime**

GOLDILOCKS: Oh Detective Maxwell, I believe in an innocent until proven
guilty stance, don’t you? As for the Bears’ home, they happen to be
close friends of mine. We have a little comedy improv routine. *She
crosses her legs, her casualness contrasting dramatically with the
serious atmosphere.* We were simply rehearsing, surely you don’t
consider that a crime?

DETECTIVE MAXWELL: Close friends, you say? Committing improv? That sure
is a funny way to go about friendship, don’t you think? Breaking in and
causing a ruckus… *He raises an eyebrow, tapping his pen rhythmically on
the table*…not what most people would call rehearsing. Can you perhaps
explain why they are pressing charges then?

GOLDILOCKS: Hmmm, pressing charges, is it? Now, that’s certainly a twist
in our little drama. *She chuckles lightly, drumming her fingers on the
side of her chair.* Could it be they thought the play had turned too
real and panicked? Or maybe they are still in character? They do take
our little performances very seriously.

DETECTIVE MAXWELL: Interesting theory, Miss Goldilocks. However,
vandalizing property and violating privacy don’t quite sound like
elements of comedy improv to me… *He leans forward, his fingers locked
in front of him.* Now, would you like to revise your interesting, yet
hard-to-believe, alibi, or shall we keep on with this little
‘performance’?

GOLDILOCKS: I see no need to change my tune, Detective. *She leans back
in her chair, a mischievous smile curving her lips.* Improv is all about
unpredictability, isn’t it? And I must say, aren’t you enjoying our
little performance here? I mean, your questioning is quite entertaining,
almost as good as our improv!

DETECTIVE MAXWELL: Your audacity does have a certain…charm, Miss
Goldilocks. But let’s not forget where we are. *He interlaces his
fingers, resting his chin on them.* This is an interrogation room, not a
stage. And your antics could land you in serious trouble, not an encore.
Is maintaining this act really worth the risk, or would the truth
perhaps serve you better?
